# Regression-of-used-car-prices
in this little project I am trying to predict the price of used cars. What makes this especial is that we have a lot of categorical variables that are nominal and have high cardinality so its very interesting to try different ways to adress this problem. In PG_1 I wanted to make a baseline by just doing some little proccesing of the data that losses a lot of information and the idea is to try to beat these base line.
The first Thing I tried to beat the base line is follow the study from Cheng Guo and Felix Berkhahn Entity embedding with categorical features (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1604.06737)
the making of the embeddings is in the making embeddings notebook
